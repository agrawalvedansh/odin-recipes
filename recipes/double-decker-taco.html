    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>The Double Decker Taco is a hybrid taco once offered at most Taco Bell locations, consisting of a soft flour tortilla wrapped around a traditional crunchy taco with a layer of refried beans serving as a mortar between the two tortillas. After the advent of the Why Pay More! Value Menu, the double deck taco is no longer a sub-$1 item. Although the Why Pay More! Value Menu offers the taco as part of their $2 Meal Deals. In the United Kingdom there is an offer called the Â£4.99 Fill Up Box where it has a Double Decker Taco but Nacho Cheese Sauce replaces the Re-Fried Beans.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix, divided</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) can refried beans</li>
        <li>2/3 cup water</li>
        <li>12 prepared crisp taco shells</li>
        <li>2 avocados</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the ground beef in a skillet over medium heat, and sprinkle about 3/4 of the packet of taco seasoning over the meat. Cook and stir the ground beef, breaking it up as it cooks, until the beef is browned and crumbly, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain the excess grease.</li>
        <li>Mash the refried beans with the water in a small saucepan, and sprinkle with the rest of the seasoning packet. Heat the refried beans over low heat until simmering.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Place the crisp taco shells on a baking sheet, and warm them in the preheated oven for 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>To make the guacamole, peel, seed, and mash the avocados in a bowl with 1 tablespoon of sour cream, the lime juice, and salt and pepper to taste, and set aside.</li>
        <li>To build the tacos, spread each flour tortilla with about 2 tablespoons of heated refried beans. Wrap the tortilla gently around a crisp tortilla shell. Spread about 2 tablespoons of ground beef along the bottom of the crisp shell, and sprinkle about 2 tablespoons of shredded Cheddar cheese on top of the meat. Top the cheese with shredded lettuce, a sprinkle of chopped tomato and onion, and a dollop of sour cream and guacamole.</li>
    </ol>
